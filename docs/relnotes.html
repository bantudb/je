<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a 100% pure Java embedded, transactional data
store. It supplies a key/object data model with indexing, full transactional
ACID support, POJO APIs and High Availability/Replication.
<p>
As of version 7.3, JE is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. See the LICENSE
file for the complete license.
<p>
Note that in JE 7.0 and later, the Java compatibility requirement for JE is
Java SE 8.
<p>
JE is compatible with Java SE 8 (64-bit) and later, and has been tested and
certified against Oracle JDK 8u73 and IBM J9 7.0. We encourage you to upgrade
to the latest Java releases to take advantage of the latest bug fixes and
performance improvements.
<p>
Be sure to see the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for information
about upgrading from earlier releases.
<p>
This release contains a number of changes, including:
<ol>
    <li>
        Added Arbiter functionality that adds additional write availability
        for replication groups that have two Electable members. For details see
        the javadoc for com.sleepycat.je.rep.arbiter.Arbiter.
        [#25567]
    </li>
    <li>
        Operation throughput statistics have been simplified and improved.
        [#23792]
    </li>
    <li>
        Data corruption is now detected as soon as possible using an internal
        JE background task. This detects data corruption caused by media/disk
        failure by reading the log sequentially and verifying checksums.
        [#25221]
    </li>
    <li>
        When a JE HA network restore is interrupted, the application is now
        prevented from using the incomplete data set. The network restore must
        be restarted when it is incomplete, and this rule is now enforced by JE.
        [#25369]
    </li>
    <li>
        EnvironmentConfig.LOG_N_DATA_DIRECTORIES has been deprecated. This
        feature is not known to provide benefits beyond that of a simple RAID
        configuration and will be removed in the next release, which is slated
        for mid-April, 2017.
    </li>
</ol>
